# Qt_Opencv_Demo

This is a demo that uses both Qt5 and Opencv, and it is a good example of learning how to use Qt5 and Opencv together in Ubuntu.

There are 6 folders, they store the following documents separately:
bin: executable files,
build: compiled files,
include:*.h,
qrc: *.qrc,
src: *.cpp,
ui: *.ui.

You can directly run the excutable program under the /bin folder.

When you click the "Start" button, the camera on your laptop will be opened, and the content captured by the camera will be displayed on the interface. And when you click the "Canny" button, the program will call the Canny algorithm in Opencv and the content will also displayed on the interface.

Tips: Before you run the demo, please make sure you have installed the Qt5 and Opencv correctly.
